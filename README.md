# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project explores the spread, trends, and impact of COVID-19 across different countries using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It provides visual analysis on cases, deaths, and vaccination progress to understand the evolution of the pandemic globally.



## Objectives of the Project
- Track global COVID-19 trends in real time.
- Compare key metrics (cases, deaths, vaccinations) across selected countries.
- Visualize data to communicate the impact of the pandemic.
- Gain insights into how different countries responded and recovered over time.

## Insights and Reflections
  1.Countries with early and widespread vaccination showed slower growth in cases and deaths.
  2.Death tolls often lag behind peaks in case counts, emphasizing the need for timely response.
  3.Accurate and consistent data reporting varies significantly across countries.
  4.Visual analytics is crucial in understanding health trends and supporting data-driven decisions.
